# homebrew-science

Science-related Homebrew tap.

## Installation

Assuming you already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can use this tap via the following terminal command:
```
brew tap gwinstanley/science
```
and then you can install its formulae as usual (```brew install ...```), and they should show up in formula searches (```brew search ...```).

Similarly, casks may be installed as usual (```brew cask install ...```).
