# homebrew-science

Science-related Homebrew tap.

## Installation

Assuming you already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can use this tap via the following terminal command:
```
brew tap gwinstanley/science
```
and then you can install its formulae as usual (```brew install ...```), and they should show up in formula searches (```brew search ...```).

Similarly, casks may be installed as usual (```brew cask install ...```). You are recommended to install casks on macOS with the `--no-quarantine` flag to ensure macOS Gatekeeper isn't obstructive when trying to run an application. (If you don't include this flag you will very likely see a message that macOS identifies the application as corrupted, and request that it be deleted.)
